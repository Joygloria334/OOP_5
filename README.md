# ðŸŽ¶ Python OOP Practice

This project contains two small Python programs that demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using fun examples.  
It explores classes, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## ðŸŒŸ Activity 1: Instruments
- Creates a base class `Instrument`.
- Adds specific instruments: `Guitar` ðŸŽ¸ and `Piano` ðŸŽ¹.
- Each instrument has its own `play()` method.

**Sample Output**
Yamaha Acoustic ðŸŽ¸ strums with 6 strings!
Steinway Grand Piano ðŸŽ¹ plays with 88 keys!

## ðŸŒŸ Activity 2: Vehicles
- Creates a base class `Vehicle`.
- Adds subclasses: `Car`, `Plane`, `Bicycle`.
- Each subclass defines `move()` differently.

**Sample Output**
 Car is driven on the road!
 Plane flyies in the sky!
 Bicycle is ppedaled along the path!
